# AppointmentSystem
A system which stores and displays appointments

## Instructions
This code works on both python 2.7.6 and 3.6.2

Make sure you have the requirements

    pip install requirements.txt

Then call RestAPI.py

    python RestAPI.py

This will run in localhost:80 by default, so you just need to open your browser and enter `localhost`

Alternatively, you may edit the hostname, portnumber, and database file name. For more info:

    python RestAPI -h

## Known Issues
I deleted the fonts to satisfy GitHubs 100 file upload limit through the browser. Things may not be as beautiful as I like.
